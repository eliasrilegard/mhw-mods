# Extended Fortify

For your long Guiding Lands sessions

## Summary

This mod extends the duration for the skill Fortify to last a bit over 9 hours instead of just 50 minutes. While 50 minutes is enough to finish any quest, for long Guiding Lands expeditions *it is going to run out*. So instead of having to reset your expedition every 50 minutes, you can now go on for 9 hours before it expiring.

<sup><sup><sup><sup>If you still manage to see "Fortify skill effect has worn off", then I salute you.</sup></sup></sup></sup>
