# Layered Kinsects

...kinda

## Summary

This mod allows you to use any kinsect you want as a layered kinsect using a workaround.

## Technical Description

While the game doesn't support layered kinsects for whatever reason, this mod emulates the layered mechanic by buffing the tier II version of every lineage to make its stats match exactly that of the Vezirstag III Forz.

## Use cautiosly

This does have the unfortunate drawback of ruining progression through the game a bit, since you'll be able to get your hands on a really strong kinsect early on. Therefore I'd only recommend installing this after you've aquired a Vezirstag III Forz legitimately, to "unlock" the layered functionality.
