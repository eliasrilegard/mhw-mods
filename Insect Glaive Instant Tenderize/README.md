# IG Instant Tenderize

A quick fix for what should've been.

## Summary

This mod makes the Insect Glaive capable of a one-combo tenderize attack without the Shaver decoration, similar to what the Dual Blades and the Sword and Shield can do.

## Technical Description

Similar to how SnS pulls off its instant tenderize, this mod adds a wounding attack on the Midair Clutch attack that applies 50 tenderize buildup. Meaning if you combo Midair Clutch -> Weapon Attack you'll apply 50 + 50 = 100 tenderize buildup, which will always soften the part regardless of if you've got Clutch Claw Boost equipped or not.
