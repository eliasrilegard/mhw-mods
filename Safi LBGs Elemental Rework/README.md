# Safi LBGs Elemental Rework

Why was Aquashot so good to begin with?

## Summary

Allows the other elemental LBGs dropped by Safi'jiiva to fire their respective elemental ammo at the same DPS as Safi's Aquashot.

## Technical Description

This mod reduces the recoil and reload of Safi's other elemental LBGs to match that of the Aquashot. This means they now are slightly better than the Alatreon Dominator for elemental gunning.
